# Finish a change: commit with its wiki ingest

Rules: [CROSS_REPO §4 and §9](../../../../CROSS_REPO.md).

1. **Implement and verify first** ([test](test.md), [build](build-and-deploy.md),
   [smoke test](smoke-test.md)). Nothing is committed until the user has tested the change and sent
   the issue link. That link is the go-ahead.
2. **Ingest into `docs/`** in the same change: the source page
   (`sources/issues/CEMENGAL-CEM_NavisworksMCP-<N>.md`, the umbrella issue's page, or
   `sources/commits/<YYYY-MM>.md` with no issue) with every decision, its reason and the rejected
   alternatives; the affected pages; new pages in `index.md`; a `log.md` entry
   (`## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | <title>`); `python ../../tools/wiki/wiki_lint.py .` with 0 errors.
3. **Commit** on `main`, staging explicit paths:
   `git commit -m "FEAT - Description. https://github.com/CEMENGAL/CEM_NavisworksMCP/issues/N"`.
   That one line is the whole message: no body, no `Co-Authored-By`. Use the user's link verbatim;
   with no issue, the plain `TYPE - Description.` form.
4. The `pre-commit` hook rejects staged code without a staged `docs/log.md` plus another `docs/` page.

Do not push unless the user asks. Never push to `upstream`.
